1,Titanic Emergency Lifeboat No. 1,"The fourth boat lowered on the starboard side. When boats 7, 5 and 3 had been filled and lowered, few people remained on the forward starboard boat deck. Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon with his wife and her secretary were among those few. They entered boat 1 as did two American gentlemen; one of whom (Charles Stengel) had seen his wife into boat 5 a few minutes earlier. Five stokers were ordered in as well as lookout Symons, in charge of the boat, and an able seaman. There were 12 in it, whereas the capacity was 40. It seems likely that the boat was lowered away with so few people in it so that the two collapsible boats nearby could be sent away as soon as possible. Later, Sir Cosmo would be accused of bribing the crew in the boat in order for them not to row back to the wreck. Apparently, this was a misunderstanding; Sir Cosmo tried to be nice and wanted the crew to get five pounds each to get new material when they reached safety.

Boat 1 was the second boat to reach the Carpathia."
2,Titanic Emergency Lifeboat No. 2,"The seventh boat loaded from the port side. Fourth Officer Boxhall was sent in charge of this boat and he had another sailor, a steward and a kitchen hand with him. Eight ladies from first class, including sisters Charlotte Appleton and Malvina Cornell found seats in the boat and six passengers from third class were there as well; Mrs. Coutts and her two young sons and the Kink family. In all, there were probably no more than 18 people in it. Boat 2 was the first boat to reach the Carpathia, shortly after 4 o'clock in the morning."
3,Titanic Lifeboat No. 3,"The third boat to be lowered on the starboard side. Officer Murdoch had just lowered boats 7 and 5 and directed the lowering of No. 3. Passengers calmly entered the boat, men and women, and when no more were around, about ten stokers entered the boat which was then lowered away. Henry Sleeper Harper brought his small dog with him. Thomas Cardeza entered the boat with his valet, his mother and her maid. Later, it was rumoured that he had dressed up as a sailor to be rescued (untrue). Mrs. Cardeza was quoted as having seen Ismay choosing the lifeboat crew for the boat in which he, Ismay, escaped, and Mr. Cardeza allegedly was one of those. Again, untrue.

Boat 3 was lowered with about 40 people in it; Thomas Cardeza counted 38 heads, not including those on the floor, Mrs. Spedden thought there were 40, including 10 or 12 stokers, Wilfred Seward of the crew estimated 50, George Moore, who was in charge of the boat, said 32 and Elizabeth Shutes thought there were 36.

It seems likely that boat 3 was lowered with 36 - 38 people in it and it was possibly the fifth or sixth boat to reach the Carpathia."
4,Titanic Lifeboat No. 4,"The eighth boat to be lowered from the port side. The boat had been lowered from the boat deck to A deck and there was some trouble before passengers could start entering it. Some of the socially most well-known ladies were gathered around the boat; the Astors, the Carters, the Wideners and the Thayers. When John Jacob Astor asked whether he might join his wife in the boat, seeing as she was in a ''delicate condition,'' he was stopped from doing so. Women and children only. When John Ryerson, age 13, was about to enter it, an officer is said to have tried to stop him, as he was old enough to stay with the men. He was let in, in the end. Eventually, about 30 passengers, mainly ladies from first class, but also some from second class, including Mrs. Richards with two small sons and also her mother, were in it. Quartermaster Walter Perkis was put in charge and there were two other seamen with him. When lowered away, at least one more crewman came down the falls and while they were trying to get away from the sinking ship, rather close to the end, eight crewmembers were plucked from the sea; Alfred White, Thomas Dillon, Frederick Scott, Samuel Hemming, Frank Prentice, Andrew Cunningham, William Lyons and Sidney Siebert; the two last ones so overcome with cold that they died in the boat shortly after having been hauld aboard. With now some 40 or 42 people on board, they received another five or six from boat 14, to which they had been attached. When 14 left them, they went, together with boat 12, to rescue those on boat B and received another 6 or 8 people from that boat and reached the Carpathia late, with perhaps 55 living survivors on board."
5,Titanic Lifeboat No. 5,"The second boat lowered on the starboard side. Third Officer Pitman was sent in charge of the boat, having five other crew with him as well as two stewardesses. Passengers were still a bit reluctant to enter the boats at this time.

""In our party,"" said Mr. Behr, ""were Mr and Mrs R. L. Beckwith and Mrs Beckwith's daughter, Miss Helen W. Newsom, all of New York. As we started out from our staterooms orders were being shouted to put on life belts. We did so quickly and then ran for the top deck, the superdeck. There was a strained calmness aboard the ship. We met Captain Smith and he shouted to all to put on life belts. Most of the passengers were gathering on deck A to get into the lifeboats. Mr Ismay was directing the launching. When Mrs Beckwith reached the second boat she asked Mr Ismay if the men could get in too. 'Certainly, Madam,' answered Mr Ismay. Then we stepped into the boat. After we were in I heard Mr Ismay calling out, 'Are there any more to get into this boat? None appeared. Mr Ismay was calm and cool and giving orders without any indication of fear. We waited three minutes, and when no one else appeared he directed that the boat be lowered. The officer in charge of our boat did not dare row back toward the Titanic for fear we would be swamped by some of the hundreds we could see swimming not far away. We floated until dawn and were about one mile away from where the Titanic went down when the Carpathia picked us up...."" New York Herald, Saturday, April 20, 1912

Several couples entered the boat, including the Kimballs, Goldenbergs, Chambers and Harders. Mrs. Stengel did not want to leave her husband. He stayed on the ship but later found refuge in boat 1. Mrs. Warren entered the boat with Miss Ostby and believed Mr Warren had followed her into the boat, but he stayed on the ship and was lost. When no more women were found, some men passengers were allowed to enter it. When the boat was in the process of being lowered, some people were slightly anxious, as it seemed they were going to 'turn turtle.' After having rowed away, they encountered boat 7 in mid-ocean and four people changed boats (cf. boat 7). Officer Pitman said that he wanted to row back to look for survivors in the water, but apparently, passengers persuaded him not to do this.

Mrs Warren thought there were 35 or 36 people in the boat, Officer Pitman estimated over 50, Karl Behr thought there were about 40, Mrs Cassebeere thought 37 and Dr Frauenthal stated 34, half of whom were men.

There were probably 35 or 36 people in the boat when lowered. No. 5 was one of the first boats to reach the Carpathia."
6,Titanic Lifeboat No. 6,"The second boat lowered on the port side (even though No. 4 had been lowered to deck A before this, so it would seem to those in the boat that they were the second to go). Not many people seemed willing to step into the lifeboats at this stage and only women were allowed in, the men having to stay behind. Some ladies were, however, persuaded to enter; Mrs. Rothschild (who very likely carried a small dog with her into the boat), Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Chibnall and her daughter, Miss Bowerman and others stepped in, finally. Mrs. Margaret Brown stated she was more or less thrown into it when it was about to be lowered away. Major Peuchen, who was allowed in because there were too few sailors around, said there were 20 women in it when they rowed away. Quartermaster Robert Hichens was put in charge and he seemed slightly terrified. Some ladies in the boat accused him of being a coward and/or drunk and there seems to have been some tension in the boat when rowing away. One young man was found in the boat and some believed him to be a stowaway, others claimed the Captain had ordered him in. In all, there were probably a maximum of 24 people in the boat when lowered away. Later in the night, they encountered boat 16 and took a fireman from that boat to help with the rowing."
7,Titanic Lifeboat No. 7,"The first lifeboat lowered on the starboard side. There was no order, according to some passengers, for ''women and children first.'' Three sailors were ordered in to man the boat. Murdoch, Pitman and possibly Ismay were near it when lowered. There was no disturbance near this boat. After having been lowered, they encountered boat 5 and four people changed lifeboats; Mrs. Dodge and her son for example, due to the fact that Mrs. Dodge wanted to row back to pick up survivors but those in her own boat, No. 5, did not turn back. Alfred Nournay is said to have fired shots from his gun during the night, at least according to Antoinette Flegenheim(er). Lookout Hogg, according to Dorothy Gibson, wrapped a sail around one or two people in the boat since they were so cold. Margaret Hays brought her Pomeranian dog into the boat, which was not very crowded. Robert Daniel said he had jumped into the sea and had been swimming around for a long time when a boat picked him up. In one interview he said that Mrs. Dodge wrapped a blanked around him after his rescue. It is probably safe to surmise that Daniel was in boat 7 when it was lowered away, as Col. Gracie suggested in his book.

Estimates vary regarding how many there were in the boat; the Bishops thought 28 (but some may have been missed when they counted), James McGough also thought 28, Gilbert Tucker thought there were 29, Mrs. Flegenheimer estimated 30 and Alfred Omont thought they were 29. No. 7 was one of the first boats to be picked up. There were 28 or 29 people in the boat when lowered."
8,Titanic Lifeboat No. 8,"Very likely the first boat lowered on the port side. The officers were strict on the port side of the ship and allowed only women passengers to enter the boats. Mrs. Penasco was persuaded to enter it together with her maid, Fermina Oliva. When the lifeboat was in the water, she realized her husband probably would not survived and had to be comforted by the Countess of Rothes. About 20 or 22 ladies had found seats in the boat, including Mrs. Straus' maid and Mrs. Allison's maid. There were four crew; two seamen, a steward and a kitchen hand. There were probably about 26 people in the boat. In the words of Mrs. Swift:

''There were twenty-two persons, including three seamen and a steward, aboard our boat, and as we were suspended over the water far below Captain Smith tucked a loaf of bread in the bow, where there were two casks of water....Slowly we dropped down, down and down until the keel of our tiny craft struck the sea and the captain shouted to pull over to a red light in the distance...we also began to realize that the seamen were not oarsmen. One was unable to pull the long heavy oar with any strength and Mrs. Swift took his place....the weak and unskilled steward and some of the other men sat quietly in one end of the boat. The countess of Rothes was an expert oarswoman.' (New York Herald, Friday, April 19, 1912)"
9,Titanic Lifeboat No. 9,"The fifth boat to be lowered from the starboard side. Purser McElroy and First Officer Murdoch seem to have supervised the loading of this boat together. Boats 1, 3, 5 and 7 held only passengers from first class besides the crew. In boat 9, the situation changed. Mrs Futrelle had been separated from her husband a bit earlier on in the night and had ended up near No. 9 into which she stepped. She believed there were about 30 people in it, including 17 crewmen; she thought they were stewards and cooks. Mrs. Aubert and her maid also entered the boat and apparently, Mrs. Aubert was in somewhat of a state during the whole rescue operation. Some ladies from second class were assisted into the boat by the six or so stewards that Purser McElroy had ordered into the boat to help passengers. When no more ladies were to be found in the vicinity, some men passengers were let in. Edward Beane had helped his wife into the ''ninth boat,'' and seeing there was room, he joined her in the boat; in a long interview in the Syracuse Herald, he said the boat was only half-filled and that he had had to jump into the sea and swim for a long time to reach it. Yet, this was not so, since boat 9 picked up nobody from the sea. He and a few other gentlemen simply entered the boat from the deck. In all, there seem to have been 35-40 people in it; twelve ladies, six or seven men passengers as well as perhaps 18 male crew members."
10,Titanic Lifeboat No. 10,"The fourth/fifth/sixth boat to be lowered from the port side. Some claim that No. 10 was the last boat lowered from the port side. Chief Baker Joughin was near this boat and said that he more or less threw people into it. Mrs. Hakkarainen, from third class, may have been the woman who nearly fell into the sea. ""One of the officers pointed at me saying, 'Room for one more lady. Come on, hurry!' As I stepped into the boat, it was already moving downward. I lost my balanced (sic), almost falling between the lifeboat and ship until someone in the lifeboat grabbed my arm and pulled me into a seat. On the way down we stopped at a lower deck and picked up one more lady. Our lifeboat did not return to the spot where the Titanic went down. Our lifeboat reached the Carpathia at 7.30 a. m. We were one of the last boats to be picked up. I finally located Anna Sjöblom, who had knocked on my cabin door to awaken me. We had become separated in the rush to the upper deck and had entered separate lifeboats."" (I'm going to see what has happened, chapter 7, pp. 9-13)

The youngest survivor, Millvina Dean, was in this boat together with her mother and brother. Her brother was taken care of by Mrs. Thorneycroft who was with them. There were perhaps seven or eight ladies from first class, possibly 15 or more second class passengers, including Mr. Hosono, who jumped into it at the last moment and possibly ten or twelve third class passengers apart from the four crew in it; a total of perhaps 40 people. When they encountered No. 14 and other boats, the two able seamen, Frank Evans and Edward Buley were transferred to No. 14. On the other hand, ten or twelve others were transferred into the boat from No. 14 and No. 10 arrived at the Carpathia with 50 or so, the last boat but one to be rescued."
11,Titanic Lifeboat No. 11,"The sixth boat lowered on the starboard side. No. 11 was lowered to the A deck and several stewards were ordered into it to assist the passengers over the railing into the boat. Steward Wheelton reported having guided about 40 women to the A deck and into No. 11. Miss Edith Rosenbaum entered the boat, carrying with her a toy, a small pig playing music. Another passenger mistook this and would later claim, rather upset, that a woman in the boat had a pig with her. Mrs. Schabert got into the boat and discovered there was space for her brother, Philipp Mock, as well. Several second class passengers entered it; Mrs. Becker and her two youngest children among them. Ruth Becker, the oldest, however, was told the boat was full and swiftly went to the next boat, i. e. No. 13, into which she got without any problem. Mrs. West and her two daughters found seats in the boat and Mrs. West would later claim that the boat was lowered at dangerous angles and she noticed that a baby was thrown in at the last moment, without its mother (as reported by others in the boat as well).

When they reached the water, it was discovered that there was no lamp in it and a sailor lighted a piece of rope to use as a light/signal. The boat was heavily loaded. It was reported to have held from 58 to nearly 80 people. The first claim is probably rather close to the truth; there were probably about ten children in the boat, about 30 ladies (including possibly nine stewardesses), three men passengers and some 16 or 18 male crew; close to 60 people. It is believed that No. 11 was about the sixth or eighth boat to reach the Carpathia."
12,Titanic Lifeboat No. 12,"Probably the third boat lowered on the port side. It would seem likely that most of the passengers in this boat were second class ladies. It is a bit unclear whether Second Officer Lightoller was supervising the loading of this boat. Miss Dagmar Bryhl tried to get the officer/s to let her brother and fiancÃ© come with her into the boat, but to no avail. ''She was taken to a boat where her brother and fiancÃ© were absolutely prohibited from entering, even though there was plenty of room in it. Miss Bryhl said there were only six persons in the boat at the time for lowering, but that they picked up about 50 from the water. ''(Nordstjernan, April 30, 1912, p. 12).

Others were persuaded to enter it, and it finally held 28-30 people when lowered away. One young man jumped into it when it was lowered and there were two sailors in it, the rest were women. When they had been in the water for a while, they encountered boat 14 and other boats, and Fifth Officer Lowe distributed his passengers in order to go back to the wreckage to see if he could save anyone. No. 12 probably received ten or twelve additional survivors from No. 14 - also, two or three crew from boat D came into No. 12. This meant that No. 12 now had about 40-45 people in it. When they heard Lightoller's whistle, they immediately rowed off and, together with boat 4, rescued those on collapsible B. About 16 or so came into No. 12 and they reached the Carpathia, now under the command of Second Officer Lightoller, with about 60 people. It was the last boat to reach the rescue ship, after eight o'clock in the morning."
13,Titanic Lifeboat No. 13,"The seventh boat lowered from the starboard side. Boat 13, as well as boat 15, had been lowered to A deck to receive passengers. Dr. Washington Dodge said:

    Boats Nos. 13 and 15 were swung from the davits at about the same moment. I heard the officer in charge of No. 13 say, Â‘WeÂ’ll lower this boat to Deck A.Â’ Observing a group of possibly fifty or sixty about boat 15, a small proportion of which number were women, I descended by means of a stairway close at hand to the deck below, Deck A. Here, as the boat was lowered even with the deck, the women, about eight in number, were assisted by several of us over the rail of the steamer into the boat, and called repeatedly for more women. None appearing, and there being none visible on the deck, which was then brightly illuminated, the men were told to tumble in. Along with those present I entered the boat. Ray was my table steward and called to me to get in.Â’ (Gracie, p. 294).

Dr. Dodge was apparently the only first class passenger to get into No. 13. Lawrence Beesley, second class, wrote extensively about his experiences in boat 13 and the Caldwells also gave several accounts.

Mrs. Sandström and her two small daughters, third class passengers en route to San Francisco, found seats in boat 13. Mrs. Sandström had nearly given up and thought they would not make it, when her steward found her (on deck) and calmed her down and helped the small family into the boat (it is implied that he also got into the boat with them). In the boat she discovered fellow Swede Anna Nysten, who had brought a food basket with her. The two ladies would correspond later in life. As was the case in almost all starboard boats; when no more women were about, men were allowed to get in. No. 13 held perhaps 25 women and children, 15 or so male passengers and some 25 male crew members; 60 or perhaps a few more in total.

When No. 13 was lowered away, No. 15 nearly came on top of it and disaster was avoided at the last second when someone found a knife to cut the ropes, allowing 13 to float away just before 15 reached the water. No. 13 was perhaps the seventh or eighth boat to reach the Carpathia."
14,Titanic Lifeboat No. 14,"The fourth/fifth/sixth boat to be lowered from the port side. Fifth Officer Lowe took charge of the boat. About 30-32 passengers were in it and there were ten or eleven crewmen and two stewardesses; probably no more than 45 in total when lowered. Lowe thought that the crowd began to be unruly and men threatened to jump into it, so as a matter of precaution, he fired a few times in the air with his gun when the boat was lowered away. Nobody was hit. People heard the shootings, however, and it may turn out that those who heard it thought that people were shot and killed. One young man had tried to enter the boat and been thrown out and either him or another man was threatened by officer Lowe, at gunpoint. When No. 14 was near the water, there was some sort of trouble and they let the boat drop three or four feet, which apparently led to the boat springing a leak and water started pouring into it, and some ladies had to take care of that problem. Later in the night, they encountered boats 4, 10, 12 and D and officer Lowe decided to distribute his passengers among the others boats, wanting to go back to the wreckage to see if he could save people in the water. It is believed that eight or ten crew remained, as well as second class passenger Charles Williams, whom Lowe took for rowing before the boat was lowered away (Williams would later claim that he had been swimming around in the water, yet officer Lowe's testimony proves that Williams entered the boat from the deck). Rowing into the area, No. 14 encountered few left alive: First class passenger William Hoyt was hauled in but died, a Chinese third class passenger was rescued as well as steward Harold Phillimore. There may have been a fourth person rescued, even though some in the crew thought there were three saved and one died and another crewman said they found four, but two died. After having rescued these people, they spotted waterfilled collapsible boat A and took the few people from it into boat 14. There were perhaps a dozen people on boat A. No. 14 reached the Carpathia, after 7 o'clock in the morning, with perhaps 28 or so people on board."
15,Titanic Lifeboat No. 15,"The eighth boat lowered from the starboard side. The boat was partly filled from boat deck, partly from A deck. Apparently, quite a few crew got in at the boat deck, then it was lowered to A deck. Steward John Hart stated in the British Inquiry that he had guided a group of 25 women and children to this boat. He may well have been the leader of a small group, although none has been found, as yet, who said they were part of such a group. Three card sharps from first class seem to have found seats in the boat, there may have been a second class gentleman in it and the rest of the passengers from third class.

Steward Samuel Rule said in the British Inquiry that there was something of a rush when the officer had said they could fill the boat up with men standing by. There is no evidence of anyone using a gun near this boat. August Abrahamsson and Johan Sundman said everything was calm and orderly when they got into it and Juho Niskanen and John Strandén reported that the crew told them to ''stay out of it,'' but they simply joined the crew when they manned the boat and were not told to get away from it.

There seems to have been very few women in/near boat 15. Trimmer George Cavell said there were only women passengers in this boat and five crew and the boat was full. Samuel Rule thought there were 68 in it, including five women and three children, i. e. 60 men. Charles Dahl thought there were 82 people in it, including eight women and seven children and trimmer Pelham also said the majority in the boat were men. It seems likely steward Rule was close to the truth; he testified at the British Inquiry, but he was recalled a few days later and was more or less forced to take back what he had said.

The boat nearly came on top of boat 13 when lowered away but disaster was avoided at the last moment. It is reported that it took boat 15 some time to get away from the ship, perhaps as much as 20 minutes. They rowed away as fast as they could and picked up nobody from the water. Boat 15 was probably about the tenth or eleventh boat to reach the Carpathia."
16,Titanic Lifeboat No. 16,"The fourth/fifth/sixth boat lowered on the port side. Strangely few testimonies tell the story of boat 16. Or, rather, there probably are some interviews pertaining to No. 16, but they have not been established as such. Third class passenger Carla Andersen/Jensen, who lost brother, uncle and fiancÃ© was very likely in this boat. She said the boat was lowered so badly that the occupants believed they would be thrown out of it when it was lowered away. It is not easy to say how many people there were in this boat, but there were at least six male crew, three stewardesses and perhaps 30 passengers, mainly third class. It is possible that Mrs. Wells, a second class passenger, describes what happened in and near No. 16:

It is a thrilling story that Mrs. Wells tells of her night ride to safety. Like so many others she did not realize her peril and had she not been literally forced into a life boat might have shared the fate of 1,600 others. ""We were all in bed, ""Mrs. Wells said, ""Joan was asleep, but I was not.

When the crash came I took the children and went on deck. I hadn't more than got there when someone grabbed me, saying: ""This way,"" and hustled me and the children up to the lifeboat. ""An officer was shouting, ""'Come on here, lively now, this way, women and children' and before I knew what was happening we were in a lifeboat, and the boat was going down the side while the men stood back serious and sober, watching us. ""I thought even then it was some sort of a drill or something, except that just as we went down I saw a revolver in an officer's hand. ""A Mrs. Davis and a little boy were in the boat with us, and she asked me what it was all about. ""As soon as the boat struck water, the seaman began pulling away with all their might. As we got away, we saw a lot of wild eyed men come rushing up from steerage, but they were met by a man with a gun who pushed them back into a crowd of men and said, ""Stand back there now, the first word out of you and I'll ----"" I didn't catch the rest. Some of the men from the first and second class cabins were standing beside the officer. ""There were 40 or 50 in our boat and I couldn't get a chance to sit down, but stood up keeping the babies warm and dry in my skirts. The sailors pulled at the oars for all they were worth, but the boat kept drifting back against the ship. Finally we got away a hundred feet and we didn't have any more trouble. We spent the night in the boat and were picked up at daybreak."" (Akron Beacon Journal, April 20, 1912)

Boat 16 stayed clear of the other boats, but encountered boat 6 and gave them a fireman for rowing. As most of the port boats, it was late in reaching the Carpathia and it was commanded by master-at-arms Bailey."
A,Titanic Collapsible Lifeboat A,"This collapsible boat was never launched as such from the Titanic. After boat C had been lowered from the starboard side, the crew tried to fasten boat A to the davits, but there simply was no more time. The boat was washed over the side of the ship and the canvas sides had not been put up, so it was soon awash with icy sea water. People started climbing into it from the water (and there may have been some in it when it was washed away as well) and some people said that it was full of people within a rather short period of time. According to some survivors, it turned turtle and the people in it were thrown out of it, but many scrambled back. Finally, it drifted away from the wreckage area and fewer people came near it. When the last swimmer arrived, there may have been about 30 people standing in the frail craft with water up to their knees. In the extremely cold water, people started dying and Richard Williams, who had seen his father disappear when they were swimming in the water and the funnel fell near them, estimated there were eleven who finally were rescued. Olaus Abelseth believed ten or twelve were saved including two Swedes. William Mellor also thought there were ten or twelve saved (out of 30 or 40 original survivors on the boat). Third class passenger August Wennerström (listed Andersson) estimated twelve survivors. He noticed a Swedish man holding on to his wife, who was in the sea and did not have the strength to get into the boat. The wife grew numb and drifted away and the husband died in the craft (according to Wennerström, he died on the Carpathia). Their wedding ring was left in the boat, however. After hours of suffering, the ten or twelve survivors were rescued by boat 14 who spied them and took them in."
B,Titanic Collapsible Lifeboat B,"This collapsible boat was never launched as such from the Titanic. When boat D had departed from the port side, the crew tried to fasten boat B to the davits, but somehow it fell from the roof of the officers' quarters and fell down to the boat deck, on its back, shortly before the sea washed over that area. The crew who had been trying to get the boat in working order simply crawled up on the overturned boat. One of those who had been there looking after the boat was Second Officer Lightoller. Together with the crew near him, he climbed onto the boat. Soon, the boat's keel was full of people.

Trimmer James McGann was one of those who helped with boat B. He said he saw the Captain jumping at the same time, but lost sight of him after that. Wireless Operator Harold Bride found refuge on the upturned collapsible boat; he also claimed to having seen the Captain jump when boat B got into the water. Fireman Harry Senior also made a comment to this effect. Colonel Gracie, a first class passenger, would later write a book about his experiences. He thought most of those on the boat were crewmembers and so did Lightoller and others. On the other hand, numerous men passengers would later claim to having been on it. Estimates as to the number of people on it vary; there may have been upward of 30 people, mainly crewmen, on it to begin with, but some of the initial survivors died during the night; a number of two or three is mentioned. It seems likely about 25 people were rescued from boat B when the crew of boats 4 and 12 heard officer Lightoller's whistle calling for them and they subsequently came over and collected those on it."
C,Titanic Collapsible Lifeboat C,"The ninth and last boat lowered on the starboard side.

Bruce Ismay had been quite active on the starboard side all night, assisting passengers into boats, more or less urging them to get away. Now, he was standing close to the collapsible lifeboat C, which had been fitted into the empty davits after boat No. 1, which had left 20-30 minutes earlier. Those near the boat seem to have been third class passengers, many from the Middle East. Quartermaster Rowe had been assisting with the Morse lamp, trying to contact ships in the vicinity and with firing rockets.

Mrs. Goldsmith and her young son Frank entered the boat with a few younger lady friends from England. When about 25-28 women and children had been assisted into the boat, five crew were ordered in as well as quartermaster Rowe. Seeing there were a few seats still free, Ismay and another first class passenger, William Carter, who had left his family at boat 4, entered it and the boat was lowered away. Mr. Ismay was later heavily criticized for his escape and he was portrayed as ''Brute Ismay'' in some newspapers. Some have theorized that he jumped into the boat, despite there being women still near boat C. Others claim there were none, and his escape was justified; he was a passenger just like any other passenger. Be that as it may, he survived, working at an oar, his back to the ship so as to avoid having to watch the end. Boat C was probably lowered away about 20 minutes before the ship sank.

While rowing away from the ship four Chinese third class passengers were discovered in the bottom of the boat. Mrs. Goldsmith noticed them along with other passengers and they told QM Rowe in charge about them. Mrs. Goldsmith thought there were 30 women, five crew and four Chinese and her son in the boat. QM Rowe thought there were 39 and Bruce Ismay estimated 40-45 in the boat.

In all likelihood, there were just under 40 people in the boat. They picked up nobody from the sea and possibly reached the Carpathia as the tenth or twelfth boat."
D,Titanic Collapsible Lifeboat D,"The ninth and last boat to be lowered from the port side. Second Officer Lightoller had managed to fit the collapsible boat into the now-empty davits of boat 1. He tried to find women to fill it with, but had trouble in finding any. Finally, he said, he managed to fill the boat with 15-20 people, ''all it would hold.'' Mrs. Harris, a first class passenger, thought there were 19 people in it, others estimated up to 30 and seaman Lucas thought there were 44 in it. Estimates vary quite a bit, thus. There is a photograph of the boat approaching the Carpathia, and there are about 30 people visible; including about ten received from boat 14 earlier in the night and also Mr. Björnström-Steffansson and Mr. Woolner, who jumped into the boat from a lower deck as well as Frederick Hoyt, who had escorted his wife to the craft and then calculated where the boat would row and thought that if he jumped and swam in that direction, they would pick him up. He was right. They did pick him up; the only person rescued from the water by the last boat which rowed away from the ship.

''Mrs. Hoyt gave a concise account of the tragedy to her father. She did not leave her husband's side until the last boat was being lowered and then she was torn from him and thrown into a boat. Mr. Hoyt leaped into the water and seized a piece of wreckage. He was hauled into one of the lifeboats that returned when the Titanic went down. Mrs. Hoyt happened to be in this boat, but she did not know her husband was saved until they got aboard the Carpathia...'' (The Sun, April 23, 1912)

There were probably about 20 or 22 (not quite half-filled) in it when he had been picked up. It is said that the two Navratil children were in this boat."
